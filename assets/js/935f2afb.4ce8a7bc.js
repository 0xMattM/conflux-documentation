Compared with the one-time storage fee in Ethereum, the CFS mechanism will be more fair and reasonable. In principle, this mechanism requires a certain amount of funds to be locked as collateral to occupy storage space. Before the corresponding storage space is released or covered by others, the collateral will be locked, and the corresponding interest generated by the locked collateral will be directly allocated to the miners for the maintenance of the storage space. Therefore, the storage cost of Conflux also depends on the length of time the storage space is occupied. Conflux specifically introduced this mechanism in detail in chaper 7 of its ConfluxProtocolSpecification.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"core/learn/core-space-basics/transactions/common-errors":{"id":"core/learn/core-space-basics/transactions/common-errors","title":"Common Errors","description":"When sending a transaction via method `cfx_sendRawTransaction`, if the transaction is not constructed correctly, the sending will fail.

Take Conflux as an example, the Conflux network normally produces two blocks per second. After a transaction is successfully sent, it should be packaged and executed within 20 seconds depending on the network congestion level. If the transaction is not packaged for a long time, it\u2019s very likely that something went wrong, and requires the sender to manually intervene.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"core/learn/getting-started/funding-your-account":{"id":"core/learn/getting-started/funding-your-account","title":"Funding Your Account","description":"Are you a new user of Conflux blockchain?
