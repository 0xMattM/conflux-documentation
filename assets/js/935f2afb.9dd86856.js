Compared to Ethereum\'s one-time storage fee, the CFS mechanism is more fair and reasonable. In principle, this mechanism requires locking a certain amount of funds as collateral to occupy storage space. This collateral remains locked until the corresponding storage space is either released or taken over by others. The interest generated by the locked collateral is directly allocated to miners for maintaining the storage space. Thus, the storage cost in Conflux also depends on the duration for which the storage space is occupied. Conflux has detailed this mechanism in chapter 7 of its Conflux Protocol Specification.","sidebar":"coreSidebar"},"core/core-space-basics/transaction_explain":{"id":"core/core-space-basics/transaction_explain","title":"Transactions","description":"The act of sending a transaction is the only method of storing or modifying data on the blockchain.

Take Conflux as an example, the Conflux network normally produces two blocks per second. After a transaction is successfully sent, it should be packaged and executed within 20 seconds depending on the network congestion level. If the transaction is not packaged for a long time, it\u2019s very likely that something went wrong, and requires the sender to manually intervene.","sidebar":"generalSidebar"},"general/faq/Errors/common_rpc_error":{"id":"general/faq/Errors/common_rpc_error","title":"Common RPC errors","description":"Common errors","sidebar":"generalSidebar"},"general/faq/faq":{"id":"general/faq/faq","title":"FAQ","description":"Welcome to our FAQ section, where we have compiled a list of frequently asked questions and their corresponding answers for your convenience.
