The mechanism involves applying the heaviest chain rule but with a modified block weight system. The block type is decided based on the block\'s historical tree-graph structure, not the miner\'s discretion. Under the GHAST mechanism, the heaviest chain rule is implemented by selecting the child block with the highest weight from the current last main chain block\'s child tree. The calculation of block weight for the subtree is no longer based solely on block count but also the sum of the weights. The GHAST mechanism, by allowing miners to generate special blocks, increases the block difficulty and slows down the block production speed, which helps to address the "liveness attack" issue.'}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(s.p,{children:"The core parts of the GHAST mechanism can be summarized as follows:"}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(s.p,{children:"The heaviest chain rule is applied, but the block has three different weights: 0, 1, X.
