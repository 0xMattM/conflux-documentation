In practice, whether or not an attacker launches a 51% attack largely depends on the benefits and costs of the attack. In terms of the attacker's gain: a successful 51% attack will not harm the mining profit. The attacker's gain may be reduced mainly for two reasons. One is the loss caused by the collapse of the token value after a successful attack; the other is the community may reach a consensus to roll back the state through a hard fork to eliminate the attacker's gain. However, nowadays blockchains have supported multiple on-chain assets and provided cross-chain services, so it is now difficult to eliminate the impact caused by a double-spending attack through a simple hard fork, which is quite different from the situation when ETC were forked from ETH."}),"\n",(0,t.jsx)(n.p,{children:"In terms of increasing the cost to the 51% attackers, there are now three response options available:"}),"\n",(0,t.jsxs)(n.ol,{children:["\n",(0,t.jsx)(n.li,{children:"Avoiding all large-scale hashing power pools.

This requires increasing the total mining revenue of Conflux to a level comparable to that of Ethereum. The current mining issuance of Ethereum is about 2.6 ETH every 13 seconds, or an average of 0.2 ETH per second. Based on the market price of 3400 USD/ETH, that gives Ethereum a mining revenue of about 680 USD per second, or about 58,752,000 USD per day. To raise Conflux's mining revenue to this level, it would require a boost of about 170 times. This means increasing the revenue of each block to $340,  that is, increasing the reward per block to over 340 CFX while maintaining the price of 1USD/CFX, or increasing the unit price of CFX by 170 times while maintaining the output.

For this reason, adding PoS finality decisions to Conflux's existing PoW consensus mechanism to improve confirmation speed and resist potential 51% attacks is in line with Conflux's goals. In addition, to reduce the complexity and potential risk of adding PoS finality mechanism, we choose to leave the selection and packaging of transactions entirely to PoW miners, and the ordering of blocks still follows the Tree-Graph ordering rules, with PoS voting only on the finality of blocks generated by PoW miners."}),"\n",(0,t.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Regarding the understanding of PoW and PoS, we have never changed: PoW is more secure but slower to confirm; PoS is faster to confirm but less secure.
