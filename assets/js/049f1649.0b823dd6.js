The concept was simple: require the email sender to solve a computational problem before sending. The computational problem is designed to be time-consuming, requiring certain amount of computational power to solve.  The receiver of the email would then verify that the sender had solved the computational problem before accepting the email. This verification process would ensure that only legitimate emails are accepted and that spammers are unable to flood the receiver's inbox with unsolicited emails."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(t.p,{children:'The idea behind this was to make it much more difficult and resource-intensive for spammers to send mass emails, while still allowing legitimate email senders to send their messages but with little inconvenience.

However, the concept of PoW was later adapted by Satoshi Nakamoto to create the peer-to-peer electronic cash system, or the blockchain "bitcoin".'}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(t.h2,{id:"bitcoins-pow-consensus",children:"Bitcoin's PoW Consensus"}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Bitcoin uses PoW mechanism to determine who can mine new blocks on the blockchain.
