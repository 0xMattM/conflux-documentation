Each instance of a smart contract is a collection of code and data that resides at a specific address on the Conflux Network. Since the state on the blockchain is fully deterministic, operations on smart contracts are guaranteed to produce the same results on all blockchain nodes. Furthermore, since smart contracts run on the blockchain, the decentralization and non-tamperable characteristics of the blockchain ensure certainty and security in the operation of the contract. Therefore, a wide range of decentralized applications (dApps) are created based on smart contracts, including games, digital collectibles (NFT), online voting systems, financial products (DeFi), etc."]}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(e.p,{children:"There are two account types on the Conflux Network: user accounts and smart contract accounts.
