Since the state on the blockchain is fully deterministic, operations on smart contracts are guaranteed to produce the same results on all blockchain nodes. Furthermore, since smart contracts run on the blockchain, the decentralization and non-tamperable characteristics of the blockchain ensure certainty and security in the operation of the contract.
