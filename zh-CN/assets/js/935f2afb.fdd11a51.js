Compared with the one-time storage fee in Ethereum, the CFS mechanism will be more fair and reasonable. In principle, this mechanism requires a certain amount of funds to be locked as collateral to occupy storage space. Before the corresponding storage space is released or covered by others, the collateral will be locked, and the corresponding interest generated by the locked collateral will be directly allocated to the miners for the maintenance of the storage space. Therefore, the storage cost of Conflux also depends on the length of time the storage space is occupied. Conflux specifically introduced this mechanism in detail in chaper 7 of its ConfluxProtocolSpecification.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"core/learn/core-space-basics/transaction_explain":{"id":"core/learn/core-space-basics/transaction_explain","title":"Transactions","description":"The act of sending a transaction is the only method of storing or modifying data on the blockchain.
