Compared to Ethereum\'s one-time storage fee, the CFS mechanism is more fair and reasonable. In principle, this mechanism requires locking a certain amount of funds as collateral to occupy storage space. This collateral remains locked until the corresponding storage space is either released or taken over by others. The interest generated by the locked collateral is directly allocated to miners for maintaining the storage space. Thus, the storage cost in Conflux also depends on the duration for which the storage space is occupied. Conflux has detailed this mechanism in chapter 7 of its Conflux Protocol Specification.","sidebar":"coreSidebar"},"core/core-space-basics/transaction_explain":{"id":"core/core-space-basics/transaction_explain","title":"Transactions","description":"The act of sending a transaction is the only method of storing or modifying data on the blockchain.

Take Conflux as an example, the Conflux network normally produces two blocks per second. After a transaction is successfully sent, it should be packaged and executed within 20 seconds depending on the network congestion level. If the transaction is not packaged for a long time, it\u2019s very likely that something went wrong, and requires the sender to manually intervene.","sidebar":"generalSidebar"},"general/faq/Errors/cfx_sendTransaction-errors":{"id":"general/faq/Errors/cfx_sendTransaction-errors","title":"cfx_sendRawTransaction Errors","description":"When sending transactions in Conflux via the cfx_sendRawTransaction method, certain errors may arise due to incorrect transaction construction or other issues.

Such a change is not backward compatible, implying that every network participant must upgrade their software to the latest version to remain an active participant within the network. Upon the execution of the hard forks, all network participants are expected to update their nodes to the newest version. Failure to do so will render them incapable of participating in the validation and verification of new transactions on the blockchain.","sidebar":"generalSidebar"},"general/hardforks/v2.0":{"id":"general/hardforks/v2.0","title":"v2.0","description":"- - -","sidebar":"generalSidebar"},"general/hardforks/v2.1":{"id":"general/hardforks/v2.1","title":"v2.1","description":"Conflux-Rust v2.1.0 is a small hardfork upgrade.

The Archive Node takes the most and the Light Node takes the least. Of course, more data consumes more hardware resources. In general, if you want to participate in mining, a fullnode will suffice . you need to run an archivenode if you want to use it as RPC service. The lightnode is mainly used as a wallet.","sidebar":"generalSidebar"},"general/run-a-node/official-bootnodes":{"id":"general/run-a-node/official-bootnodes","title":"Official Bootnodes","description":"Bootnodes is a list of nodes that a conflux node trusts, and will be used to sync the blockchain when a node starts.
